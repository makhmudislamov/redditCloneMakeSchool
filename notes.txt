BLOCKER at 12/2. Page 4 - Test:
Error message >>> done() is not called
SOLUTION: 
(Vincenzo) >>> 1) declared chai:
const chai = require("chai");
const chaiHttp = require("chai-http");
const should = chai.should();
2) instead of .request(localhost: 3000) do .request(server) after const server = require('../server')
3) while npm run test, nodemon server.js should be off


BLOCKER at 12/3 >> jumped to page 7 sign in/log in
added subreddit input fields >> page 5 (issue)
then posts/new route stopped working.
